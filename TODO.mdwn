# Permits record start to record errors.

There are some use cases where we need to record commands that fail (throw
exception).

There are no needs to record tequila failures such as _no such class_, _no such
method_ or _not enough arguments_.

Here are some potential solutions.

## Globally enables error recording.

The first and straightest solution is to add a new optional boolean parameter to
`record start` which enables it for the whole recording session.

The downside is that errors due to typos in arguments are still recorded.

## Provides a command to force the recording of a error.

A `record force` command could be use to force the recording of a command
regardless whether an exception has been raised.

## Prompts whether to record the error.

**ACCEPTED**

When an error occurs, prompts the user wheter or not he wants to record it.
